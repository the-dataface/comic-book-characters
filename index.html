					<h1>Overweight Men and Underweight Women In Comic Books</h1>
					<h2>Societal Body Types Preferences, Illustrated by Comic Book Characters</h2>
				</div>

			<section class='copy-section'>
				<p>Captain America is overweight. At a height of 6’1”, he weighs in at a hefty 240 pounds - 50 pounds heavier than expected for someone of that height. But this doesn’t mean the First Avenger needs to go on a diet - it means he’s the epitome of what society considers the ideal male body type.</p>
				<p>It’s no secret film casting favors muscular actors. Or that magazines glorify ultra-thin women. Slim, petite women and muscular, broad men take center stage in all types of popular culture. But comic book creators can take it one step further - they illustrate their characters, designing them in whatever image they please. How these fictional characters are drawn may speak volumes to societal body type preferences.</p>
				<p>Do the characters in Marvel and DC universes follow patterns we see in film, magazines, and advertising? Who’s the most represented in this pop culture juggernaut?</p>
